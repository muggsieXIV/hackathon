/* 
    Given an array of ints, find all the non-consecutive integers
    A number is non-consecutive if it is NOT exactly 1 larger than the previous element.
    The first element is never considered non-consecutive.
    Return an array of objects where each object contains the number itself
    and it's index.

    nonConsecutive([1,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,14]) should return 
    [   { i: 1, n: 3 }, 
        { i: 4, n: 7 }, 
        { i: 7, n: 11 }, 
        { i: 8, n: 14 } 
    ]
